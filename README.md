This is my C# project “Shirley’s Creations”.

To use this project you will need VS code. This project also uses Newtonsoft, Microsoft Dotnet Test SDK, Xunit, Xunit Runner Visual Studio, and ExchangeRate-API from exchangerate-api.com.

This project is a store front console application that allows users to exit the program at anytime by pressing 0. Return to the main menu at anytime. View a list of products with a description for each product. View the price of each product in USD as well as GBP, and CAD, add products to a cart and view the items in cart, and Ask Shirley a question and/or request a custom order.

This project includes/does the following:

1. A master loop that the user may choose to exit at anytime.
2. Multiple lists populated with several values.
3. Reads data from an external Json file.
4. Connects to an external API, reads data, and then uses that data
5. Uses a conversion tool (API) that converts USD to CAD or GBP.

Unfinished or Work in progress features include:

6. Log to record errors and exceptions.
7. Field to input email address and then check to see if it is valid.
8. Unit tests.
